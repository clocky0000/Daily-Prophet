            <div class="main-text multi-column">
                <p>In an unexpected turn of events, the wizarding world is abuzz as Harry Potter was taken into custody
                    early this morning by the Ministry of Magic. Officials state that Potter, renowned for his role in
                    defeating the dark wizard Voldemort, was arrested in connection with the unauthorized use of
                    powerful dark artifacts. Witnesses report that Ministry officials arrived at Potter’s residence at
                    dawn, executing a swift arrest that left the local magical community in shock.</p>
                <p>According to sources within the Ministry, several prohibited items were found in Potter’s possession,
                    which could lead to serious charges under the Magical Law Enforcement Act. Minister of Magic,
                    Hermione Granger, expressed her disappointment, emphasizing that no one is above the law, not even
                    heroes of the wizarding world. The arrest raises questions about Potter's current activities and
                    affiliations since his departure from the limelight.</p>

                <h4>Harry Potter Defends with Illegal Wand!</h4>
                <div class="multi-column">
                    <p>Chaos erupted last night as Harry Potter used an illegal wand to thwart an attack by dark wizards
                        in Diagon Alley. Eyewitnesses report that Potter was ambushed by a group of masked assailants,
                        believed to be remnants of Voldemort’s followers, intent on causing havoc. With no time to
                        spare, Potter allegedly used a banned wand, capable of highly unpredictable and powerful magic,
                        to defend himself and the bystanders.</p>
                    <p>
                        The use of such a wand has sparked controversy within the wizarding community, raising concerns
                        about the means Potter is willing to adopt to ensure safety. The Ministry of Magic has launched
                        an investigation into the incident, with officials debating the legality of Potter's actions
                        given the circumstances. Despite the controversy, many citizens have voiced their support for
                        Potter, arguing that his quick thinking prevented what could have been a catastrophic event.
